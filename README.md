This repo contains past and ongoing machine learning projects.

## LendingClub
This project is an analysis of default rates in loan data from Lending Club. Please download and open the HTML version to make use of the hyperlinked footnote system.

## CloudEditing
This project is a suite of editing tools I'm building. The goal is to edit extremely large video files almost entirely on google colab. This will allow folks to edit professional quality films on relatively cheap computers. It's still a work in progress.

## TextSwitch
This project is an attempt to solve a common problem. You've got a scanned image of some paperwork, but one of the dates in the paperwork is incorrect. I'd like to build a tool that allows users to simply highlight the incorrect date and change it, and the program will do the work of making the new date appear as if it was written on the original document. It's still a work in progress.
